# ddapp
full stack data science project that builds machine learning model then implements into production
via Flask app/API

I have pulled English Premier League Match/Score Data for 2017/18 season and the current season
and have started to analyze the data.  Next, I to develop machine learning model using the data 
to generate predictions based on user entered data on Flask app which I'm callin dapp given 
my initial, dd. 

data source: https://datahub.io/sports-data/english-premier-league 
(includes field descriptions and csv/json data formats)

The data is pretty current, so after I implement everything I hope to write a script to 
use the football-data.org API to pull update match statistics programmatically so that 
the model and its API can be updated automatically using an Airflow instance.

feel free to fork and submit for pull requests if you want to work with me 
on this.
